# CPU-Schedule

program using C++  that simulates two of the CPU scheduling algorithms;
one non-preemptive such as (FCFS, SJF, and priority) and one preemptive 
such as (SRT, priority, and RR). The program should ask the user to input the process info 
such as burst times, arrival times, and priorities of the processes
then calculate waiting time for each process and the average waiting time.
